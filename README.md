## op-framework
The op-framework project has in goal to provide a fully functional FiveM roleplay server (made from scratch) with advanced and highly developed features.

All development is done by me (Ben/InZidiuZ). No development will be rushed, making sure it is done properly and thoroughly. I expect to push regular updates introducing new features, bug-fixes, and balancing changes.

OP-FW is written in Lua, but HTML, CSS & JavaScript is also used a lot for the UIs.

## issues
