## op-framework
The 'OP Framework' project has in goal to provide a fully functional FiveM roleplay server with advanced and highly developed features, all made from scratch.

All development is done by me (@InZidiuZ#6969). No development will be rushed, making sure it is done thoroughly. I expect to regularly push updates introducing new features, bug fixes and balancing changes.

For more information, join the official [OP-FW discord guild](https://discord.gg/yRBWkjb).

## Issues
It is requested that you report any issues you may encounter with the OP Framework in the "Issues" tab in this GitHub repository.

Issues related to assets, should at this time be reported in [this](https://github.com/InZidiuZ/legacy-assets-issue-tracker/issues) GitHub repository.

## Rules
To make sure we're all on the same page about what this issue tracker is meant for, please read through and follow the rules below.

**§ 1.** All issues should be in English, *and only English*.<br/>
**§ 2.** Give your issue a proper title.<br/>
**§ 3.** When creating an issue, select **and follow** a template.<br/>
**§ 4.** Your issues should include as much *relevant* information as you can provide.<br/>
**§ 5.** Suggestions should be specific and structured, and not vague and undetermined.<br/>
**§ 6.** The framework is meant to be easily scalable and future proof, meaning creating issues to request a 'turf' and 'storage container' for your gang should not be done. Be more creative and propose something that *is* scalable and dynamic.<br/>
**§ 7.** Don't create an issue on a topic that already has an issue open. **Always use the search function before creating an issue!** Instead, use the already existing issue to add onto the topic.<br/>
**§ 8.** Engaging in the comment section of issues is encouraged, though please **do not** post comments without any value, i.e. "+1" comments. Use GitHub's reaction feature for such instead.
