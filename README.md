# OP Framework — Issue Tracker (Archived)

This issue tracker is no longer active.

We’ve moved all bug reports, suggestions, and discussions to our Discord forum:
- Discord: https://discord.gg/opfw
- Channel: [#problems-and-ideas](https://discord.com/channels/618449264271687682/1231998343014514818)

Please create new threads there for:
- Script issues, feature requests, and gameplay suggestions
- Bug reports with steps to reproduce, logs, and screenshots where possible

Asset-related issues (maps, models, vehicles, textures, collisions, liveries) should still go here:
- Legacy Assets Issue Tracker: https://github.com/InZidiuZ/legacy-assets-issue-tracker
